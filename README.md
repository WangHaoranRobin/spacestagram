## What could be better:

1. Like button
2. Paginate backend fetch of liked posts. Rn it fetch everything at once, which creates issues when a user has many likes
3. When images are too long or too wide, give it make height/width and make it scrollable
4. More secure auth lol
5. Better mobile experience. Might be many bugs cuz I didnt test much
